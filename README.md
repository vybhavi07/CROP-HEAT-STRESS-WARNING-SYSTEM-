🌱 Crop Heat-Stress Warning System

<p align="center">
  <b>Low-Cost Analog Temperature Monitoring and Early Warning System</b>
</p>📌 Project Overview

The Crop Heat-Stress Warning System is a low-cost analog electronic system designed to monitor temperature conditions and provide visual and audio warnings when crops are exposed to excessive heat.

Using an LM358 operational amplifier as a comparator, an NTC thermistor, and three LED indicators, the system identifies different temperature conditions without requiring a microcontroller or Arduino.

🚨 Problem Statement

High temperatures can cause heat stress in crops, affecting plant growth, productivity, and agricultural yield.

Farmers may not always identify rising temperature conditions early enough to take preventive action.

This project aims to provide a simple, affordable, and real-time warning mechanism to help identify potentially harmful temperature conditions.

💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed system uses an NTC thermistor to sense temperature variations. Two LM358 comparator circuits compare the sensed temperature against predefined reference levels.

Based on the temperature condition, the system activates different indicators:

- Green LED – Normal temperature (Below 30°C).
- Yellow LED – Warning condition (30°C–35°C).
- Red LED and buzzer – High-temperature alert (Above 35°C).
